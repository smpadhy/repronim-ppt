### Reproducible Research

- Each project in a lab depends on complex software environments
  - Operating system
  - Drivers
  - Software dependencies
     - Python/MATLAB/R versions
     - glibc
     - various other libraries, executables

--
- Each project has its own timeline
  - Maintaining common software repositories is "Oh so 20th century!"
  - Really hard on systems like Openmind
     - One of these days modules will clash

--
- Reproducible research requires consistent computing environments
  - Data **AND** code **AND** compute environments
  - Passing environments has not been straightforward
